```bash
git clone https://github.com/karim3487/price_tracker_backend.git
cd price_tracker_backend
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
uv init
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
uv install
```

### 4. Configure environment

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-local-secret-key
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

uv run manage.py migrate
uv run manage.py runserver
celery -A price_tracker worker --loglevel=info
celery -A price_tracker beat --loglevel=info

## üê≥ Running with Docker

### 1. Copy `env.example` and rename to `.env.docker`. Refactor them

### 2. Build and run containers

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## üîÑ Periodic Tasks

The project uses `celery-beat` to periodically check product prices.

- You can configure tasks via Django Admin using `django-celery-beat`
- Or via `CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE` in settings

---

## üì¨ Webhooks from Scrapy

The external Scrapy service should POST updated price data to:

```
POST /api/price_histories/update_price/
```

Payload example:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/product",
  "price": 89.99
}
```

## üìß Notifications

When a price drop is detected, the system can notify users via:

- Telegram bot
- Email (SMTP settings required, not included in this README)
